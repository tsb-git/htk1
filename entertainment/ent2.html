					<p>2018 seems like a year of Bollywood weddings. At a time when B-Town watchers were busy lapping up every single detail from Sonam Kapoor and Anand Ahuja's big fat Punjabi wedding, Neha Dhupia surprised everyone by posting a picture with husband Angad Bedi from their Gurudwara wedding. And now, another couple is ready to take the plunge. Bollywood's very own Bajirao Mastani, Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone are ready to make things official. After being in a relationship for over five years, Deepika and Ranveer are rumoured to be tying the knot this November. While the lovebirds have remained tight-lipped about their wedding, rumours suggest Deepika and Ranveer will be man and wife by the end of 2018. A leading magazine reported that the couple will exchange garlands in an intimate wedding at the picturesque Lake Como in Italy. November 20 has been finalised as the wedding date. Yes, you read it right. If rumours are to be believed, Ranveer and Deepika will be married by the end of November. Here's all you need to know about one of the most-anticipated weddings of 2018. SAVE THE DATE While Ranveer and Deepika have been busy indulging in social-media PDA, news about their marriage is making headlines every now and then. Latest reports suggest that Ranveer and Deepika will exchange garlands on November 20 in the presence of family and close friends. Kabir Bedi confirmed the news when he congratulated the couple on the news of their wedding. He wrote on Twitter, "Great couple! Great locale in Italy! Great event! Wishing @RanveerOfficial and @deepikapadukone a wonderful wedding, and a lifetime of happiness." DESTINATION WEDDING If Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma chose Tuscany in Italy for their grand wedding, Deepika and Ranveer have zeroed in on Lake Como in Italy as their wedding destination. According to a leading magazine, the much-awaited wedding will take place at Lake Como in Lombardy, Italy. Lake Como boasts of a spectacular view, with the picturesque Alps towering over its northern end. "Both Ranveer and Deepika were keen on having a destination wedding in Italy and they have finalised Lake Como as their wedding destination. The place is dotted with exquisite villas along the shoreline, which is why both of them decided to wed in this beautiful place," a source close to the couple told the magazine. GUEST LIST Taking a cue from Virushka wedding, Ranveer and Deepika too want to keep their wedding an intimate affair. Buzz has it that they have invited only family and very close friends to the wedding. "It's a very special day for both Ranveer and Deepika, which is why they just want the close ones to be present for their wedding ceremony. Mostly, it will be their families and a few close friends. The guest list consists of merely 30 people and that's exactly how these two want it," the source added. Ranveer and Deepika are expected to host lavish receptions once they return to the country as a married couple.</p>

                    <h2>Teachers’ Day celebration of South Point  </h2> <h2>Ex-students’ Association’s Care Wing </h2>
					<p>The unique initiative of the ASPEXS Care Wing covers medical, emotional and financial support for retired teachers of South Point. Care Wing volunteers in 2008 started locating their old teachers and visiting them. The teachers, from their 60s to 80s, were overwhelmed. Irrespective of their age and fading memories, their eyes sparkled at the mention of their school and their beloved students. The list also included teachers who had short teaching stints in South Point before taking up other assignments. A few amongst them are the noted actors Shri Barun Chanda and Smt Paramita Biswas, who had their career debut in Satyajit Ray’s Seemabaddha, Shri Utpal Chatterjee, journalist and former Sheriff of Kolkata, and Smt Ipshita Roy Chakravarti, the famous Wiccan, among others.

As words spread about ASPEXS Care Wing, Pointers from all corners of the globe came forward with contributions which helped the Care Wing to build a corpus for catering to the medical needs as well as financial exigencies of the retired teachers. Care Wing also organized a number of medical camps, where, apart from consultation facilities with Pointer doctors, blood tests & health check-up were conducted.

It has been a decade since the Care Wing commenced its journey. Picnics and trip to the Dakshineswar temple have been organized as well as cultural programmes on the occasion of Teachers’ Day. Notable amongst the latter was the screening of the Bengali film Muktodhara (a unique statement on the teacher-student relationship), followed by an interaction with the Director & cast of the film & also the real life characters on whom Muktodhara was based, & screening of the film Chittagong (the heroic tale of Masterda/Surya Sen and his students’ struggle for the freedom of India) followed by an interaction with its director, Shri Bedabrata Pain, once again a Pointer.

Pointers have thus truly re-defined the word ‘care’, renewing the bonds with their teachers who are now in their twilight years, taking reverse care of their mentors, without whose guidance they might not have been able to taste success in life.

					<br><p>  This year, Aditya Group initiated Shyama Samman 2018, and has rewarded the best Shyama Pujas’ across Barasat, Birati, Basirhat and Madhyamgram areas of West Bengal, on 18th of November 2018, at Aditya School of Sports Arena, Taki road Kadambagachi, Barasat Kolkata 700125.
The selected jury members of Aditya Group had visited the participating puja pandals on 5th, 6th and 7th November where the results were declared on 8th of November 2018. The awards and recognition has given these puja committees an opportunity to connect with the audience of the city at an emotional level. 
As the years are passing by, Shyama Pujas started becoming more culture-conscious and different forms of idols and theme wise representation of puja pandals made an essential place in this occasion. More importantly, it ensured that various forms of art, culture and community celebrations imbibed with religious fervor, all remained intact over the years. The Shyama Samman Awards would help to create an acknowledged platform of expression for all categories of the society during this festive season.s</p>

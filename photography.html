					<p>“A photograph is a moment – when you press the button, it will never come back,” said René Burri. The Swiss photographer, who documented several political, cultural events and historical events in the second half of the 20th century, captures the essence of photography in this quote. The moment might be fleeting, but once photographed it gets frozen for a lifetime. Photographs have the potential to evoke memories and take us back to the past. To mark the importance of pictures, every year on August 19, World Photography Day is celebrated. On this day, those who share the passion for photography come together and observe this day. Many, all across the world, commemorate this day by capturing stills and spreading joy through them.

The day also serves as an inspiration for many to take up photography as a profession or to pursue it as a zealous hobby.

On the occasion of World Photography Day, we bring you some of the most iconic photos by different photographers. The list, however, is in no way exhaustive but these works continue to impress.
There are moments which occur only for fraction of a second and goes away in the blink of an eye. I dreamt about this shot where a bird flies over the horizon just above the setting sun. We all know that Kashmir is a Paradise and I feel lucky enough to capture the shot I dreamt about at this heavenly place. The sun was setting fast and there was very less light to capture a perfect shot. I forgot my DSLR back in the hotel and was just carrying my OnePlus smartphone while roaming near Dal Lake. It was at this moment when I saw birds continuously flying over the lake. OnePlus never disappointed me in the past when it comes to capturing photos and it proved its worth again at this moment. Fast, sharp and colour accurate photos - that's what you get from OnePlus smartphones.

					<p>World Photography Day is held on August 19 and while we know that nothing can quite compete with DSLR photography, smartphone photography is rapidly creating a space for itself. These photos that have been shot with a OnePlus can easily go toe-to-toe with those clicked on a digicam. These shots prove that all you need is a good eye and smartphone on hand to click beautiful photos. Had to go on the outskirts of the city as there won't be much pollution so as to capture the stars. Took many sample shots before executing this one and found that lit backdrop light coming from a factory across the road. This was shot on my OnePlus 6 in complete darkness at 9 pm, thanks to the pro mode for letting me shoot with more options in low light. With pro mode, it's possible to adjust the amount of light you need and also for how much duration. The settings were ISO: 2500, Shutter Speed: 20seconds and focus set to infinity so that the stars would be clearly visible.</p>

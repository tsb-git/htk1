                    <h2>The 4th edition of 'Nature Quiz' was held at Heritage School, organised by the Rotary Club of Calcutta</h2>
					<div class="post_box">
					<br><p>The 4th edition of 'Nature Quiz' was held at Heritage School organised by the Rotary Club of Calcutta Yuvis and Interact Club of Adamas International School, in association with the NGO Saevus. 41 schools consisting of 123 students participated in this grand quiz. DPS Ruby Park emerged victorious whereas MP Birla High School and Birla High School came as joint second. Heritage School took the third position.

This is the fourth consecutive year of the quiz which has been pivotal in creating awareness about environment and wild life. Quiz Master Rajib Sanyal appreciated the efforts of the students of class V/VI/VII from all over Kolkata and remarked, "I am indeed proud to say that the students have exceeded my expectations. The spontaneity of the students and the maturity is indeed a welcome sign for the young generation."

President of Rotary RTN Sharad Khatore was all in praise for the youngsters. He candidly confessed,"I am indeed spellbound by the efforts of the students. Congratulations to the teachers and guardians as well. After all, the whole initiative from Rotary is indeed creating a holistic environment. We are indeed proud to see that all schools are coming forward." Meghna Halder, the showstopper of the event mentioned," I really felt like going back to my childhood days. Some of the questions were indeed tricky. I think Quiz is one of the better modes for creating awareness on nature. I hope in the coming years, more schools will participate in such a noble initiative."

Brajagopal Kundu, IP DG Rotary applauded the efforts of the students and remarked,"Last year I attended the event and this year as past Governor. Both the times, I have been spellbound by the efforts of the students and this is inspiring for the students as well. After all, we at Rotary believe in inspiring others. I am 73 years old and I can proudly say that I am learning from the kids as well. The participation has been fantastic and the initiative is definitely on the right track."

Autri Chatterjee, a Class VI student of Adamas International School said,"It was a great day for me and my teammates Soham and Saranya. We have learnt a lot through our participation in the quiz." Aniket Singh, a Class VII student of ST Joseph & Mary School remarked," This is the second time our school has participated in the competition. Although we qualified for the first semi final yet we couldn't qualify for the finals. But we are not sad at all. After all, we have learnt a lot regarding wildlife from this quiz itself. It has been a great experience and we are looking forward to the next edition of the quiz in next year." Bitan Roy, Mohammed Zeeshan and other participants too echoed similar viewpoints. </p>                    <div class="cleaner"></div>

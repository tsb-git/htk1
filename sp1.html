                    <h2>South Point Annual Prize Distribution ceremony:

Recognition of grit & excellence</h2>
					<br><p>All eyes were on Adrija Mukherjee (Class II) of South Point School on Thursday, 4 July 2019, when she received the Priyamvada Birla Brave Hearts Award from Janab Firhad Hakim, Mayor of Kolkata and Hon’ble Minister-in-Charge, Urban Development and Municipal Affairs, Government of West Bengal, at the Annual Prize Distribution Ceremony of the School at Nazrul Mancha.

 

Adrija is fighting congenital scoliosis, a rare spinal disorder, entailing a painful vertebral malfunction. She has to wear a hard brace from her chest to her abdomen.  The award (Rs. 9,000 and a certificate), introduced by the M. P. Birla Smarak Kosh in 2006, salutes differently abled students coping with academics despite challenges.

</p>
					<br><p>Janab Firhad Hakim lauded the indomitable spirit and quest for knowledge of South Pointers, not only in the field of education, but also sports and cultural activities--all that it takes to make a complete human being of tomorrow. He said that our children are our best assets and appreciated the way South Point is taking care of them.

 

Shri H V Lodha, Chairman, MP Birla Group, and President, South Point Education Society, thanked Janab Firhad Hakim for his august presence, despite his busy schedule.

 

Shri Lodha said work on the Priyamvada Birla Campus of South Point at Mukundapur, off the EM Bypass, is on in full swing. It will be a unique education campus, second to none in the world, meant for more than 12,000 students, with a built-up area in excess of 7.50 lac sq.ft., comprising more than 280 class rooms, 36 laboratories and a host of sports and co-curricular facilities. The project will get completed by the end of 2021. The Campus has been recognized by UNDP as an Energy Efficient Model Building Project.

 

He said South Point School received the Daan Utsav Kalyan Samman in 2018 for its contribution to the community. In 2017 too, it got the Daan Utsav Shiksha Samman for its strong commitment to giving back to society in the field of education.</p>
					<br><p>Every year, the M.P. Birla Smarak Kosh (South Point) sponsors the passage of deserving South Pointers for pursuing higher studies abroad. The recipient this year is Anchita Addhya. She will pursue Ph.D. in Molecular Engineering at the University of Chicago. The Satikanta Guha Memorial Award (Founder’s Medal) was given to Shalini Bhattacharya (Class V), Abdhi Das (Class X) and Angikar Ghosal & Adrita Das (both Class XII). The M P Birla Special Talent Award went to Divyani Mohanty (Class VIII) for excellence in the field of dance, while the recipient of the M P Birla Award for Excellence in Co-curricular Activities was Pubarun Basu (Class XII).

 

The M.P. Birla Memorial Awards consisting of a cheque worth Rs 9000, a medal and certificate will be given to the school toppers at the All India Secondary School Examination and the All India Senior School Certificate Examination. The

awardee in AISSE 2019 is Suchana Halder. Debanjan Das is the School Topper in AISSCE 2019. This year’s award for the State Topper in AISSE 2019 goes to Sumaita Laisa and to Pointer Debanjan Das who is the AISSCE 2019 State Topper.</p>
					<br><p>Under the aegis of the Kosh, awards were handed over to winners of inter-school competitions hosted by South Point, which included quiz, one-act play, chess, singing, essay writing and debate. The prestigious Puja Utkarsh Samman 2018 awards for the Best Durga Idol, Best Pandal, Best Ambience and ‘Puja with a Heart’ were also given away.

 

ASPEXS (South Point Ex-Students’ Association) conferred the ASPEXS Award for Excellence to Hemant Khandelia (Class XII), a star pupil of AISSCE, 2019 Batch, and the West Bengal topper in NEET, this year.

 

The students of South Point School presented a dance drama, ‘Happy Hues of Childhood’, when life seemed to be like a rainbow, when one derived joy from fun and games. It was unlike the children of the modern generation, bogged down by studies and trapped in digital technology. South Point High School presented a ballet, ‘Kolkata’. A group of children from the suburbs sets out on a secret expedition to the city. The contrasting images of the vibrant, bustling City of Joy mesmerize them. As they return to the suburbs, they feel that they have left behind a part of their soul in the city. More than 300 students participated in both the presentations.</p>
